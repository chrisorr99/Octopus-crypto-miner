# Octopus-crypto-miner
Reads the current electricity price from the Octopus agile tariff and enables crypto mining if the electricity price is below a threshold.
### Octopus agile
Octopus agile is a tariff which gives you exposure to wholesale market price which settles every 30 minutes in the UK. During times of oversupply (often caused by renewables) electricity prices can fall extremely low, or even fall below zero.

To switch to the Octopus agile tariff you must first be an Octopus customer. You can sign up using my code for **Â£50 off**

### Prerequisites
1. You must have python installed
2. You need to decide which crypto you want to mine, or you can use a program that automatically select the most profitable coin. I use CudoMiner (headless installation) and have written the code to work with this program. You can sign up using my referal link: https://www.cudominer.com/?a=piXdwRMZm
3. Calculate your threshold electricty price at which it is profitable to mine. This will depend on your hardware and a good resource to check this is https://whattomine.com
